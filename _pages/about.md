I'm an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://computing.uga.edu/" target="_blank">School of Computing</a> and a faculty fellow at the <a href="https://www.ai.uga.edu/">Institute for Artificial Intelligence</a> at the University of Georgia. I'm also a <a href="https://ctl.uga.edu/faculty/faculty-fellows-programs/lilly-teaching-fellows/">Lilly Teaching Fellow</a>. 

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at <a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell Tech</a>, working with <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~snavely/">Prof. Noah Snavely</a>. I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Maryland. My PhD advisor is <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~djacobs/" target="_blank">Prof. David Jacobs</a>.
I was in a 3+2 program where I received a Master's degree in Computer and Information Science from Temple University and my Bachelor's degree in Automation from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). My advisor in Temple was <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~hling/" target="_blank">Prof. Haibin Ling</a>.

My research area is <strong>computer vision</strong>--understanding our world using visual data with the help of state-of-the-art deep learning models. In particular, I'm passionate about understanding people in diverse and complex environment using images and videos. I believe A.I. can and should be developed to improve people's quality of life.
